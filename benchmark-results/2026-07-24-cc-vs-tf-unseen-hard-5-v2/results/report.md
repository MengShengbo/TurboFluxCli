## Primary Results

| System | Tasks / runs | Success | R@10 (95% CI) | MRR (95% CI) | MAP | nDCG@10 | Full@10 | p50 / p95 | Tools | Tokens in/out |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| fastcontext | 5 / 5 | 100.0% | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 | 1.000 | 100.0% | 86.9s / 111.3s | 57.6 | 18855 / 3948 |
| claude-code-readonly | 5 / 5 | 100.0% | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 [1.000, 1.000] | 1.000 | 1.000 | 100.0% | 63.4s / 149.7s | 8.8 | 44019 / 1441 |

Scores include failures and timeouts as zero. Repeats are averaged within each task before 10,000-sample bootstrap confidence intervals are computed across tasks; latency and token means use successful runs only.

## Protocol

- Task: rank implementation files that require editing for a real issue at its pre-fix repository commit.
- Ground truth: non-test implementation paths changed by the human gold patch. Test paths are retained in the manifest but excluded from the primary score.
- Inputs: original issue text and repository snapshot only. Gold patches, hints, PR discussions, tests, git history, network, and editing are unavailable to agents.
- Output: at most ten ranked, read-grounded repository-relative paths. Primary metrics are Recall@10, MRR, MAP, nDCG@10, full-file coverage, success rate, and latency.
- Ordering: deterministic rotated system order for each case/repeat. JSONL journaling makes every completed run resumable and auditable.
- Statistical tests: paired random-sign permutation test on Recall@10; bootstrap confidence intervals. No uncorrected significance claim should be made across many slices.

## Dataset Provenance

- [SWE-bench Verified](https://openai.com/index/introducing-swe-bench-verified/) contains 500 human-validated tasks sampled from resolved GitHub issues and associated PRs in 12 Python repositories. OpenAI reports 93 professional Python developers, three annotations per sample, and 1,699 screened candidates.
- [SWE-PolyBench](https://github.com/amazon-science/SWE-PolyBench) contains real issue-closing PRs with executable tests. Its verified split spans Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python and publishes file/CST localization metadata.
- [Agentless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01489) established hierarchical file-to-symbol-to-location localization on SWE-bench. It is a method, not an independent dataset.
- [CodeRAG-Bench](https://github.com/code-rag-bench/code-rag-bench) motivates BM25/dense retrieval metrics but mixes task families; it is therefore background rather than the primary issue-localization set here.
- [RepoQA](https://github.com/evalplus/repoqa) evaluates retrieval of a described needle function from long repository context. It measures a narrower capability than issue-to-edit localization and is not pooled into the primary result.

## Validity Limits

- Gold patch files are a defensible but incomplete relevance judgment: an alternative valid fix may touch different files, and incidental human edits can create false-positive gold paths.
- Public GitHub tasks can appear in model training data. This experiment measures scaffolded retrieval on public tasks, not contamination-free generalization.
- Claude Code uses its default agent with only Glob/Grep/Read enabled and enters a disclosed local Anthropic Messages to OpenAI Responses bridge. FastContext uses OpenAI Responses and OpenCode uses OpenAI-compatible Chat.
- CLI systems include different proprietary/default system prompts. Equal model, task, permissions, and output contract do not make token budgets or internal instructions identical.
- SWE-bench Verified is Python-only; cross-language conclusions require the SWE-PolyBench slice and should be reported separately.
